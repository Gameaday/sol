# Sol - Project Summary

## What is Sol?

Sol is a 2D retro RPG built with Flutter and Flame, serving as a prequel to the classic Golden Sun series. It tells the untold story of how Alchemy was sealed away 1000 years before the original game.

## The Story

### Setting
An age when Alchemy flowed freely through the world, creating a society divided between those who could wield it (Adepts) and those who couldn't (non-adepts). A powerful faction seeks to capture the Master Djinn and use their power to control all Alchemy through massive tower beacons.

### Heroes
- **Venus Alchemist** (Earth, HP/PP) - Questions adept supremacy
- **Mars Alchemist** (Fire, HP/PP) - Former soldier turned rebel
- **Mercury Witch** (Water, HP/MP) - Scholar of ancient wisdom
- **Jupiter Sorcerer** (Wind, HP/MP) - Visionary outcast mage

### The Journey
1. **The Call** - Form party, learn about tower project
2. **The Race** - Fail to save Venus and Mars Master Djinn (arrive too late)
3. **The Guide** - Meet Wise One, learn the sealing plan
4. **The Assault** - Successfully save Jupiter Master Djinn
5. **The Depths** - Successfully save Mercury Master Djinn
6. **The Sacrifice** - Witch and Sorcerer give their lives to seal Alchemy

### The Outcome
The two surviving alchemists found Vale village at the base of Sol Sanctum to guard the sealed elemental stones. Peace reigns for 1000 years... until the world begins dying without Alchemy, leading to Golden Sun's events.
