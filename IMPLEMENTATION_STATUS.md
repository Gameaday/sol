## Risk Assessment

### Current Risks

1. **Content Volume** - 8 chapters with extensive branching dialogue
   - **Mitigation:** Reusable templates, consistent structure, parallel development
   
2. **Scope Creep** - Temptation to add features beyond plan
   - **Mitigation:** Strict adherence to implementation plan, milestone reviews

3. **Balance Issues** - Difficulty tuning across 40+ hours of gameplay
   - **Mitigation:** Iterative testing, data-driven adjustments, playtest feedback

### Opportunities

1. **Modular Design** - Easy to add DLC chapters or side stories
2. **Community Content** - Dialogue and quest system could support user content
3. **Cross-Platform** - Flutter enables easy deployment to multiple platforms
