# Sol - Game Story and Lore

## Story Overview

Sol is a prequel to Golden Sun, set in the ancient era before the sealing of Alchemy. This is the untold story of how the world transformed from an age of limitless alchemical power to the sealed world players discover in the original Golden Sun.

## Setting: The Age of Alchemy

### The World Before the Seal

In this era, the world was vastly different:
- **Limitless Geography**: The land was boundless, with new continents and islands continuously forming through alchemical forces
- **Elemental Chaos**: The four elements (Earth, Fire, Wind, Water) ran rampant across the world
- **Alchemy Everywhere**: Nearly everyone possessed some degree of alchemical ability
- **Magical Abundance**: Psynergy flowed freely, making extraordinary feats commonplace

### Society and Prejudice

The prevalence of Alchemy created a deeply divided society:
- **Adepts**: Those who could wield Alchemy were considered superior beings
- **Non-Adepts**: Those without alchemical powers faced severe prejudice and cruelty
- **Social Structure**: Power and status were determined entirely by alchemical prowess
- **Discrimination**: Non-adepts were treated as lesser beings, denied rights and opportunities

### The Alchemical Towers Project

A powerful faction of adepts sought to harness even greater power:
- **The Plan**: Capture the Master Djinn (elemental incarnations of pure alchemical force)
- **The Process**: Condense each Master Djinn into concentrated elemental spheres
- **The Purpose**: Use these spheres to power massive towers that would act as beacons
- **The Goal**: Focus and control all Alchemy, making it easier to manipulate and bend to their will
- **Hidden Agenda**: Consolidate power among the strongest adepts, further marginalizing non-adepts

## The Heroes

### Act 4: The Betrayal and the Lighthouses

**Meeting the Wise One:**
- Party brings all four spheres to the Wise One
- Receives guidance on how to properly seal Alchemy
- Warned of betrayal but party must continue forward
- Prepares for journey to the lighthouses

**The Theft:**
- Night before departing for the lighthouses

- Thieves are tower project leaders planning to activate all lighthouses

**Jupiter Lighthouse - The Key:**

**Why This Matters:**
- The lighthouses were built but NEVER successfully lit
- This explains their structural fragility in Golden Sun
- After 1000 years dormant, they break when finally activated

### Act 5: The Great Sealing

**Preparation - Calming the First Two Elements:**
- With all four spheres recovered, party prepares for the sealing
- Venus and Mars spheres contain compressed, hostile elemental forces
- These two were never properly communicated with (captured while party was late)
- **Must enter and calm/defeat** Venus Master Djinn within its orb consciousness form
- **Must enter and calm/defeat** Mars Master Djinn within its orb consciousness form
- These battles take place inside the consciousness realms of the elemental spheres
- Successfully calming them unlocks:
  - **Replay fights**: Can re-battle all Master Djinn for practice
  - **Enhanced Psynergy**: Deeper connection to Venus and Mars elements
  - **Special abilities**: Unique powers from understanding compressed elements
- Jupiter and Mercury Master Djinn are already cooperative (defeated honorably)
- All four elements now ready for sealing

**The Dilemma:**
- Sealing Alchemy will save non-adepts but end the Age of Wonder
- The world will become smaller, less magical
- Many adepts will lose their identity and purpose
- The party must accept what they're about to do

**The Sacrifice:**
- To properly seal the elemental forces requires immense Psynergy power
- The Witch and Sorcerer realize they must channel all their life force
- Emotional farewells with their companions
- The two sacrifice themselves to complete the seal at Sol Sanctum

**Sol Sanctum:**
- The four elemental spheres are sealed in a sacred chamber
- The remaining heroes (Venus and Mars Adepts) found a village at the mountain's base
- They establish the guardian tradition to prevent anyone from releasing Alchemy
- The village of Vale is born

### Epilogue: A Thousand Years of Peace

**The Immediate Aftermath:**
- Magic fades from the world
- Adepts lose most of their power
- Non-adepts and adepts become truly equal
- Monsters are sealed away
- The world becomes stable and predictable

**The Hidden Cost:**
- Without Alchemy supporting the world's structure, it slowly weakens
- The guardians of Sol Sanctum don't realize their protection dooms the world
- A thousand years pass in relative peace
- Until the world begins to die from lack of Alchemy...

**Bridge to Golden Sun:**
- The events of the original game begin
- The "villains" of Golden Sun are actually trying to save the world
- The seal must be broken to restore Alchemy before it's too late
- The cycle continues...

## Core Themes

- In Golden Sun: Prevents unsealing unless those attempting it prove their virtue
